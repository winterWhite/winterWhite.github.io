This makes 10mm x 10mm a good minimum touch target size.]\n\n## Mind the order\n\n- The order for buttons should reflect the nature of a conversation between the user and the system\n- User interface is a conversation with your users\n\n## Avoid using too many buttons\n\n- Think about the most important actions you want your users to take\n\n## Provide visual or audio feedback on interaction\n\n- When users don’t have any feedback, they might consider that the system didn’t receive their command and will repeat the action. \n- For some options, it’s worth not only acknowledging user input but also show a current state of the process.\n\n# 7 Practical Tips for Design\n\n## Use color and weight to create hierarchy instead of size\n\n- Try and stick to two or three colors\n    - A dark (but not black) color for primary content\n    - A grey for secondary content\n    - A lighter grey for ancillary content\n- Two font weights is usually enough for UI work\n    - A normal font weight (400 or 500 depending on the font) for most text\n    - A heavier font weight (600 or 700) for text you want to emphasize\n    - Stay away from font weights under 400 for UI work\n    \n## Don’t use grey text on colored backgrounds\n\nMaking the text closer to the background color is what actually helps create hierarchy, not making it light grey\n\nText work with colorful background: \n\n- Reduce the opacity of white text, Use white text and lower the opacity\n- Hand-pick a color that’s based on the background color [This works better than reducing the opacity when your background is an image or pattern]\n\n## Offset your shadows\n\nInstead of using large blur and spread values to make box shadows more noticeable, add a vertical offset. It looks a lot natural.  \n\nMaterial Design: <https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html>\n\n## Use fewer borders\n\nInstead using border to distinguish two elements from one another, try some more methods. Because too much borders makes your design feel busy and cluttered.\n\n- Use a box shadow [more subtle and accomplish]\n- Use two different background colors [Giving adjacent elements slightly different background colors]\n- Add extra spacing [Spacing things further apart is a great way to create distinction between groups of elements]\n\n## Don’t blow up icons that are meant to be small\n\nIcons that were drawn at 16–24px are never going to look very professional when you blow them up to 3x or 4x their intended size.\n\nIf small icons are all you’ve got, try enclosing them inside another shape and giving the shape a background color, This lets you keep the actual icon closer to its intended size, while still filling the larger space.\n\nsome icon website:\n\n- <https://fontawesome.com/>\n- <http://www.zondicons.com/>\n- <http://www.heroicons.com/>\n- <https://useiconic.com/>\n\n## Use accent borders to add color to a bland design\n\nIt's a simple way to make your design more \"designed\"\n\n<https://dribbble.com/colors/e3c0ac>\n\n## Not every button needs a background color\n\nWhen designing actions, it’s important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.\n\n- Primary actions should be obvious. [Solid, high contrast background colors work great here.]\n- Secondary actions should be clear but not prominent. [Outline styles or lower contrast background colors are great options.]\n- Tertiary actions should be discoverable but unobtrusive. [Styling these actions like links is usually the best approach.]\n\n# Form Design For HTML5\n\n<https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/ux-html5-mobile-form-part-1/?utm_source=mobiledevweekly&utm_medium=email>\n\n# Color Design\n\n<https://uxplanet.org/bright-colors-in-ui-design-benefits-and-drawbacks-433680f0a1c7>\n\n# 书单\n\n<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11R5U4v__YNqPcENM7ui2OsUK7hLWLlEKg6H8yaO8us8/edit#gid=0>\n\n# How to be a UX／UI Designer\n\n<https://blog.nicolesaidy.com/7-steps-to-become-a-ui-ux-designer-8beed7639a95>\n\n<https://uxplanet.org/12-mobile-ux-design-trends-for-2018-5b4ce7e8445f>\n\n- Form Design <https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/best-practices-for-mobile-form-design/>\n\n<https://uxplanet.org/ux-design-how-to-use-animations-in-mobile-applications-a8257ebffe90>\n\n<https://heydesigner.com/blog/the-10-commandments-of-good-products/>\n\n# Some Good Writer in Medium\n\n<https://medium.com/@johnyvino>\n\n<https://medium.com/@101>\n\n<https://uxdesign.cc/@fabriciot>\n\n<https://medium.com/@tubikstudio>\n\n<https://medium.com/@pablostanley>\n\n<https://medium.com/@ireneau>\n\n<https://medium.com/@usemuzli>\n\n<https://medium.com/@Prototypr>\n\n<https://medium.com/@tiffanyeaton>\n\n<https://medium.com/@justinmind>\n\n<https://medium.com/@bestfolios>\n\n<https://medium.com/@soulless>\n\n<https://medium.com/@Mockplus>\n\n","tags":["Design"]},{"title":"CSS System","url":"/2018/08/30/CSS-System/","content":"\n## Some Css Action\n\n- Naming conventions 命名约定\n- BEM, SMACSS\n- CSS style sheet language extension\n- CSS Modules with React\n- Sass，Less\n- File architecture 文件结构\n- Atomic CSS, ITCSS\n- CSS frameworks，Bootstrap\n- Javascript frameworks，React、Vue、Angular\n\n## CSS Course\n\n- CSS Grid：<https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE>\n- Cross Browser: <https://css-tricks.com/using-feature-detection-to-write-css-with-cross-browser-support/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-328&utm_medium=email>\n- CSS evolution: <https://medium.com/@perezpriego7/css-evolution-from-css-sass-bem-css-modules-to-styled-components-d4c1da3a659b>","tags":["CSS"]},{"title":"Front End Performance","url":"/2018/08/30/Front-End-Performance/","content":"\n# Check List\n\n<https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Performance-Checklist>\n\n### Performance tools\n\nList of the tools you can use to test or monitor your website or application:\n\n * 🛠 [WebPagetest - Website Performance and Optimization Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/)\n * 🛠 ☆ [Dareboost: Website Speed Test and Website Analysis](https://www.dareboost.com/) (use the coupon WPCDD20 for -20%)\n * 🛠 [Treo: Page Speed Monitoring](https://treo.sh/?ref=perfchecklist)\n * 🛠 [GTmetrix | Website Speed and Performance Optimization](https://gtmetrix.com/)\n * 🛠 [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)\n * 🛠 [Pingdom Website Speed Test](https://tools.pingdom.com)\n * 📖 [Pagespeed - The tool and optimization guide](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/)\n * 📖 [Make the Web Faster | Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/speed/)\n * 🛠 [Sitespeed.io - Welcome to the wonderful world of Web Performance](https://www.sitespeed.io/)\n * 🛠 [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/)\n * 🛠 [Website Speed Test | Check Web Performance &raquo;

Prefetches and preconnects allow the browser to lookup the DNS information and start establising a TCP connection to the server hosting the font file. This provides a performance boost because by the time the browser gets around to parsing the css file with the font information and discovering it needs to request a font file from the server, it will already have pre-resolved the DNS information and have an open connection to the server ready in its connection pool.\n\n    *How:*\n    > ⁃ Before prefetching your webfonts, use webpagetest to evaluate your website <br>\n    ⁃ Look for teal colored DNS lookups and note the host that are being requested <br>\n    ⁃ Prefetch your webfonts in your `<head>` and add eventually these hostnames that you should prefetch too\n\n    * 📖 [Faster Google Fonts with Preconnect - CDN Planet](https://www.cdnplanet.com/blog/faster-google-webfonts-preconnect/)\n    * 📖 [Make Your Site Faster with Preconnect Hints | Viget](https://www.viget.com/articles/make-your-site-faster-with-preconnect-hints/)\n    * 📖 [Ultimate Guide to Browser Hints: Preload, Prefetch, and Preconnect - MachMetrics Speed Blog](https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/guide-to-browser-hints-preload-preconnect-prefetch/)\n    * 📖 [A Comprehensive Guide to Font Loading Strategies—zachleat.com](https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/#font-face)\n\n- [ ] **Webfont size:** ![medium] Webfont sizes don't exceed 300kb (all variants included)\n\n * 📖 [Font Bytes - Page Weight](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesFont)\n\n- [ ] **Prevent Flash or Invisible Text:** ![medium] Avoid transparent text until the Webfont is loaded\n\n * 📖 [`font-display` for the Masses](https://css-tricks.com/font-display-masses/)\n * 📖 [CSS font-display: The Future of Font Rendering on the Web](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-font-display-future-font-rendering-web/)\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Images\n\n![images]\n\n * 📖 [Image Bytes in 2018](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesImg)\n\n* [ ] **Images optimization:** ![high] Your images are optimized, compressed without direct impact to the end user.\n\n    *Why:*\n    > Optimized images load faster in your browser and consume less data.\n\n    *How:*\n    > ⁃ Try using CSS3 effects when it's possible (instead of a small image) <br>\n    ⁃ When it's possible, use fonts instead of text encoded in your images <br>\n    ⁃ Use SVG <br>\n    ⁃ Use a tool and specify a level compression under 85.\n\n    * 📖 [Image Optimization | Web Fundamentals | Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/image-optimization)\n    * 📖 [Essential Image Optimization - An eBook by Addy Osmani](https://images.guide/)\n    * 🛠 [TinyJPG – Compress JPEG images intelligently](https://tinyjpg.com/)\n    * 🛠 [Kraken.io - Online Image Optimizer](https://kraken.io/web-interface)\n    * 🛠 [Compressor.io - optimize and compress JPEG photos and PNG images](https://compressor.io/compress)\n    * 🛠 [Cloudinary - Image Analysis Tool](https://webspeedtest.cloudinary.com)\n    * 🛠 [SVGOMG - Optimize SVG vector graphics files](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)\n\n\n* [ ] **Images format:** ![high] Choose your image format appropriately.\n\n    *Why:*\n    > To ensure that your images don't slow your website, choose the format that will\n\n    *How:*\n    > ⁃ Use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to identify which images can eventually use **next-gen formats** (like JPEG 2000m JPEG XR or WebP) <br>\n    ⁃ Compare different formats, sometimes using PNG8 is better than PNG16, sometimes it's not.\n\n    * 📖 [Serve Images in Next-Gen Formats  |  Tools for Web Developers  |  Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/webp)\n    * 📖 [What Is the Right Image Format for Your Website? — SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-the-right-image-format-for-your-website/)\n     * 📖 [PNG8 - The Clear Winner — SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/png8-the-clear-winner/)\n     * 📖 [8-bit vs 16-bit - What Color Depth You Should Use And Why It Matters - DIY Photography](https://www.diyphotography.net/8-bit-vs-16-bit-color-depth-use-matters/)\n\n- [ ] **Use vector image vs raster/bitmap:** ![medium] Prefer using vector image rather than bitmap images (when possible).\n\n    *Why:*\n    > Vector images (SVG) tend to be smaller than images and SVG's are responsive and scale perfectly.

However, without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it.

Regroup your JavaScript code inside external files or eventually in the `<head>` or at the end of your page (before `</body>`).\n\n    *Why:*\n    > Placing JavaScript embedded code directly in your `<body>` can slow down your page because it loads while the DOM is being built. The best option is to use external files with `async` or `defer` to avoid blocking the DOM. Another option is to place some scripts inside your `<head>`. Most of the time analytics code or small script that need to load before the DOM gets to main processing.\n\n    *How:*\n    > Ensure that all your files are loaded using `async` or `defer` and decide wisely the code that you will need to inject in your `<head>`.\n\n     * 📖 [11 Tips to Optimize JavaScript and Improve Website Loading Speeds](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/11-tips-to-optimize-javascript-and-improve-website-loading-speeds/)\n\n* [ ] **Non-blocking JavaScript:** ![high] JavaScript files are loaded asynchronously using `async` or deferred using `defer` attribute.\n\n    ```html\n    <!-- Defer Attribute -->\n    <script defer src=\"foo.js\"></script>\n\n    <!-- Async Attribute -->\n    <script async src=\"foo.js\"></script>\n    ```\n\n    *Why:*\n    > JavaScript blocks the normal parsing of the HTML document, so when the parser reaches a `<script>` tag (particularly is inside the `<head>`), it stops to fetch and run it. Adding `async` or `defer` are highly recommended if your scripts are placed in the top of your page but less valuable if just before your `</body>` tag. But it's a good practice to always use these attributes to avoid any performance issue.\n\n    *How:*\n    > ⁃ Add `async` (if the script don't rely on other scripts) or `defer` (if the script relies upon or relied upon by an async script) as an attribute to your script tag. <br>\n    ⁃ If you have small scripts, maybe use inline script place above async scripts.\n\n    * 📖 [Remove Render-Blocking JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/BlockingJS)\n    * 📖 [Defer loading JavaScript](https://varvy.com/pagespeed/defer-loading-javascript.html)\n\n* [ ] **Optimized and updated JS libraries:** ![medium] All JavaScript libraries used in your project are necessary (prefer Vanilla JavaScript for simple functionalities), updated to their latest version and don't overwhelm your JavaScript with unnecessary methods.\n\n    *Why:*\n    > Most of the time, new versions come with optimization and security fix. You should use the most optimized code to speed up your project and ensure that you'll not slow down your website or app without outdated plugin.\n\n    *How:*\n    > If your project use NPM packages, [npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check) is a pretty interesting library to upgrade / update your libraries.\n\n    * 📖 [You may not need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/)\n    * 📖 [Vanilla JavaScript for building powerful web applications](https://plainjs.com/)\n\n- [ ] **Check dependencies size limit:** ![low] Ensure to use wisely external libraries, most of the time, you can use a lighter library for a same functionality.\n\n    *Why:*\n    > You may be tempted to use one of the 745 000 packages you can find on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), but you need to choose the best package for your needs. For example, MomentJS is an awesome library but with a lot of methods you may never use, that's why Day.js was created. It's just 2kB vs 16.4kB gz for Moment.\n\n    *How:*\n    > Always compare and choose the best and lighter library for your needs. You can also use tools like [npm trends](http://www.npmtrends.com/) to compare NPM package downloads counts or [Bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) to know the size of your dependencies.\n\n    * 🛠 [ai/size-limit: Prevent JS libraries bloat.
